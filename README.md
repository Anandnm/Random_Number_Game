Certainly! Here's a description of the provided Java code for the number guessing game:

The program begins by importing the Scanner class from the java.util package, allowing it to read user input from the console.

The NumberGames class encapsulates the entire program. Inside the class, the main method serves as the entry point for the program's execution.

In the main method, the program initializes several variables:

sc: An instance of the Scanner class for reading user input.
playAgain: A boolean variable that controls whether the user wants to play another round of the game.
totalGames: An integer variable that keeps track of the total number of games played.
toTotalAttempts: An integer variable that tracks the total number of attempts made across all games.
The program enters a while loop that continues running as long as the user wants to play again (playAgain is true).

Inside this loop, the program initializes variables related to the current game:

minValue and maxValue: Define the range of numbers for the guessing game.
generatedRandomValue: Generates a random number within the specified range.
attempts: Tracks the number of attempts made by the user in the current game.
guessedCorrectly: Indicates whether the user has guessed the correct number.
Within another while loop, the program allows the user to make guesses within a limit of 8 attempts or until they guess the correct number.

After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

If the user guesses correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed along with the number of attempts. If the user exceeds the attempt limit without guessing correctly, the program displays the correct number.

The program updates the total number of attempts and total games played after each round.

After each game, the program prompts the user if they want to play again. If the user chooses to play again (by entering "YES"), the loop continues. Otherwise, the loop ends, and the program displays a thank-you message along with the average number of attempts per game.

Finally, the program closes the Scanner object to release system resources.
